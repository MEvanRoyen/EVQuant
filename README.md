## EVQuant; high-throughput quantification and characterization of extracellular vesicle (sub)populations

The EVQuant assay is developed to detect individual fluorescently-labeled vesicles such as biological extracellular vesicles (EVs), but also a variety of synthetic vesicles like liposomes and polymersomes. EVQuant is able to quantify the total number, size and biomarker specific subpopulations of extracellular vesicles in several minimally processed biological fluids (e.g. cell-conditioned media and urine). The assay is based on detection of fluorescent nanoparticles using a confocal microscope. Acquired images are analyzed using the open source software FIJI using the EVQuant plugin.


## Installation Guide

EVQuant is a plugin for FIJI (Fiji Is Just ImageJ) the latest version of FIJI can be found at https://fiji.sc and runs on all common platforms (windows,macOS,Linux).

To install the EVQuant Plugin download the _EVQuant.jar file from this repository (https://github.com/MEvanRoyen/EVQuant/blob/master/_EVQuant.jar) open Fiji and install the plugin using the menus Plugin -> Install Plugin

The programs of the EVQuant PlugIn can nouw be found in the Plugin -> EVQuant menu.
